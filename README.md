# Book Reader App

This is a **Book Reader App** built using **Android Kotlin** following **MVVM architecture** and various Android best practices. The app allows users to create accounts, browse books, read their details, and manage their reading lists. The app integrates **Retrofit** for API calls, **Dagger-Hilt** for dependency injection, **Room Database** for local storage, and **Firebase** for authentication and cloud database operations.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Users can create an account using Firebase Authentication or log in with their existing credentials.
  - A **splash screen** is displayed on the first launch, followed by user authentication.

- **Home Screen**: 
  - Displays the **Recent Reading List** and **Most Recent Single Book** with user ratings.
  - Ratings are fetched from Firebase Firestore and displayed on the home screen.

- **Search Functionality**: 
  - Users can search for books using an API integrated via **Retrofit**.
  - On search results, users can click on a book to view its details.

- **Book Details Page**: 
  - Displays the book's **author name**, **release date**, and **description**.
  - Users can rate the book, and their rating is saved and displayed on the home screen.

- **Room Database Integration**: 
  - Book data is stored locally in the **Room Database** to manage the user's reading list.

- **Firebase Firestore**: 
  - CRUD operations are performed using **Firebase Firestore** for managing user-specific data, such as reading lists and ratings.
